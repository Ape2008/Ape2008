On Halloween, there will be a fellow;
You gone take his peen'
He's big and black - he will take your candy
That fellas name is "Big D Randy."


Big, D D Randy , he take booty not just candy
He dress up like he a granny
Then he be waitin' for fellas to walk off alone
He make sure they ain't near no home
He sneak up and he let out a moan
He rip off your booty and then he is gone
I remember one day, it was like 2012
It was big Randy - I could just tell
He took my booty and I couldn't yеll
I got to the house. Mama said, "wherе is yo' ass -
And where is yo' candy?"
And I said, "Mama... it was Big D Randy!"
"He came out of nowhere, On god he appeared
And then he ran off with my rear."
"He took my whole booty and all of my candy
But you should be lucky that I'm even here."
"Randy is the real deal - he usually finish the kill;
I guess I got lucky."
"I don't know how I made it out of there alive
Before that big fella could f*ck me."
{Bridge}
Randy!
He is the one!
Hide your daughters and hide your sons!
Randy!
He is the one!
Hide your daughters and hide your sons!
 
{Interlude}
(Randy speaking)
"Ahh, Digbar."
"Bring that ass back here."
(Digbar speaking)
"No! Get away from me."
(Interesting Noises.)
"No please stop!"
"Ahhhhhhhh"


 
{Verse Two}
Aye
If he get you, you can not escape
So just be ready 'cause that booty's gonna get raped
Randys takin' everybody, he ain't scared of nothin'
It's Halloween so he'll turn that booty to his pumpkin
He dresses up as granny, it's a disguise
Then he walks up on you and looks you dead in yo' eyes
The fella just be like "Hey", "Wassup", "How was your night."
Then he catch 'em off-guard when he start
f*ckin' they butt with his pipe
He do it so good, he do it so right
He takin' the booties on Halloween night
And if yo' cake end is tight, he's gonna take it alright
So don't even put up a fight
{Chorus}
On Halloween, there will be a fellow;
You gone take his peen'
He's big and black - he will take your candy
That fellas name is "Big D Randy."


 
{Post-Chorus}
He's big and black - he will take your candy
That fellas name is "Big D Randy."


 
{Bridge}
Randy!
He is the one!
Hide your daughters and hide your sons!
Randy!
He is the one!
Hide your daughters and hide your sons!
 
{Outro}
(Echo)
Hide your daughters and hide your sons!
Hide your daughters and hide your sons!
